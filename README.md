# Kickstarter-Challenge


# Overview of Project

Louise is a writer who wants to start a crowdraising campaign to fund her play "Fever", her estimate budget for this play is $ 10.000.
We will be using excel to organize, sort and visualize data to give Louise insights on other successful campaings that were done before.
We will be focusing on analyzing data based on Launch Date and Goals to better understand how these factors helped other campaigns so Louise can mirror hers.
We will also be going over the challenges and failures that other campaigns had, this will help Louise avoid those risks and have a better chance in succeeding and reaching her goal.


# Analysis and Challenges

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
Based on the outcome per launch date chart, May and June have the highest count of successful campaigns.
This can be related to several factors:
People tend to go out more and be socially active when the weather is nicer, in most countries and States May and June are not too cold nor too warm, it's the spring season where most people are excited to go out.
The end of the school year is around these months and probably families look for social events where they can take their kids to have a good time, theater and plays can be a great way to have fun. 
These 2 factors bring more engagement which will surely help Louise's campaign succeed.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
Campaigns who have $1000 or less goal have the highest success and lowest failure rates.
While setting a goal for a campaign, its important to set realistic goals and base most decision on them. 
The higher the goal, the bigger the fundraising event will be, more invitations, more time and money investment.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
Based on the outcome per launch date chart, September, October and November are the only months that have cancelled campaigns, have the lowest success rates and the highest failiure rates, this may be due to the colder weather, students getting back to school and usually these months tend to be busier before the end of the year.
The outcome per goal chart shows that campaigns within the same goal range of Louise's campaign($ 10.000) had almost 50% success and 50% failure,
which is a high risk to take, considering lowering the fundraising event goal can help Louise have a better chance reaching her goal, have a successful campaign and saving herself time and money. 


# Results:

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Weather makes a big difference when it comes to launch date, sometimes of the year tend to be busier, these can majorly affect the campaign.

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest number of campaigns launched had their goal between $1000 and $4999 and they had high percentage of success. The higher the goal, the higher the failiure risk and the lower success chnaces will be.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset doesn't show the volume of people who participated in these campaigns, their age range and gender. Knowing your target audience and understanding their preference can make a big difference in this type of events.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
What genre of art events related campaigns are more successful, this comes back to understanding your target audience, people's engagement is the most important factor, knowing what kind of arts people prefer might help Louise promote for her fundraising event differently and focus on what grab people's attention more.
